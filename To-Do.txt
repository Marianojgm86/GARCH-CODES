TO DO
- Add more controls related to inflation in persistance modelling
 - International Commodity prices (petroleum, food index?)
 - Output? Expectations? problem with data availability

- Add controls in ARMA/GARCH models
 - Controls in the mean modeling inside the GARCH(p,q) models with observed inflation
 - Same controls used in the persistance models

- Multivariate GARCH models using variables like US inflation, commodities, output, expectations, etc.
